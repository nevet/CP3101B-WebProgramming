      <h2> The Background </h2>
      <p>The classic children book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Runaway_Bunny" target="_blank">"The RUNAWAY BUNNY"</a> by Margeret Wise Brown and Pictures by Clement Hurd that has extremely simple plot (it is a children book after all):</p>
      <blockquote>
       A small rabbit wants to run away but his mother tells him that "if you run away, I will run after you..."
      </blockquote>
      <p>But our version is a bit different, instead of bunny, it's CAT in our version :) You can navigate the story by clicking left and right arrows.</p>
