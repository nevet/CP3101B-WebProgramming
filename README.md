# CP3101B Learning Track

This repo tracks the progress of my CP3101B, i.e. Web Programming, learning process. 

The course consists of 7 labs on different toics + a term project. I will host all labs in this repo, and the term project in a separate repo.

## Lab 1

This lab talks about basic `HTML5`, `CSS3` and some simple `JavaScript`. The lab requires to use multiple `HTML5` tags, and some `CSS` styling. Beyond the requirement, I also added some simple `CSS3` animations and transformation. The live demo is [here](http://cp3101b.comp.nus.edu.sg/~huangda/lab1).

## Lab 2

This lab talks about more on `JavaScript`. The lab requires to develop an online puzzle game interface. In short, the puzzle contains multiple checkpoints that must be visited in a certain order, and all cells except the starting cell must be visited by at most once, while the starting cell must be visited twice. The live demo is [here](http://cp3101b.comp.nus.edu.sg/~huangda/lab2).
