# CP3101B Learning Track

This repo tracks the progress of my CP3101B, i.e. Web Programming, learning process. 

The course consists of 7 labs on different toics + a term project. I will host all labs in this repo, and the term project in a separate repo.

# Lab 1

This lab talks about basic `HTML5`, `CSS3` and some simple `JavaScript`. The live demo is [here](cp3101b.comp.nus.edu.sg/~huangda/lab1).
